# Nuclei Segmentation and Analysis using Detectron2 & YOLOv8

This project demonstrates how to perform nuclei segmentation and analysis using Detectron2 and YOLOv8. The process includes downloading and cleaning data, converting masks to appropriate annotation formats, visualizing annotations, and training models for object detection.


This project covers the following steps:

1. Downloading data from Kaggle
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipateam/nuinsseg?resource=download
3. Cleaning up the data
4. Converting masks to COCO JSON and YOLOv8 annotations
5. Visualizing annotations
6. Training Detectron2 (Mask R-CNN) for object detection
7. Training YOLOv8 for object detection

With downloadable code for every task.
